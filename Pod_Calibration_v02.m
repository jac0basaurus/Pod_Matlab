%% USAGE NOTES
%{
This code is based on Ricardo Piedraheta's Pod_calibration_generation
code, with attemps to make it more readable and more easily modified.
This was developed on Matlab R2017b, so some unhandled errors may be caused
by the use of different versions.

%% List of currently implemented functions that can be used in the settings lists above
%***Implemented modeling functions for regression and classification problems
%{
Regression:
-fullLinear - fits Y as a linear function of all columns of X
-fullLinInt - same as fullLinear, but also includes interaction terms
-linearSensors - designed to use our knowledge of sensors that are appropriate to the current pollutant and then fits a linear model using those + temperature and humidity
-line1 - fits Y as a linear function only of the first sensor in "podSensors"
-line1T - adds time as an independent predictor and adds an interaction term to allow for changes in sensitivity over time
-line1_loess - same as line1, adds a surface fitted to the residuals with respect to T and Rh and then adds those results to the line1 fit
-line3 - fits the podSensor as a linear function of Y, T, Rh and then inverts the model to predict Y
-line3T - same as line 3, but including an interaction between the temperature and Y
-line4 - fits the podSensor as a linear function of Y, T, Rh, elapsed time, and then inverts the model to predict Y
-line4T - same as line 4, but includes interaction between temperature and Y
-linePCA - maps X into principal components and then fits a simple linear regression with interaction terms
-joannaNN - uses all columns and the settings that Joanna developed for using ANN to regress methane concentrations
-podGPR - Tries to optimize and then apply a gaussian process regression (Kriging) to the data based on all columns of X
-podM5p - Uses a custom function to fit M5' regression trees where each "leaf" has a linear fit at the end instead of a raw numerical prediction
-podNN - Tries to optimize the number of neurons in a two layer neural net, with the option to have 0 in 2nd layer, which is a 1 layer net
-podPLSR - Use partial least squares regression to select relevant parameters from a high dimensionality "X"
-podRFR - Tries to optimize then apply a random forest regression model. Hyperparameters optimized are the minimum number of leaves and number of parameters to select from at each edge
-podStepGLM - Use R^2 (or others with minor modifications) to select terms for a GLM regression with a log-normal distribution
-podStepLM - Use R^2 (or others with minor modifications) to select terms for a linear regression in a stepwise fashion
-smart4T - Similar to "linearSensors" but usese 'fitnlm' to fit a similar equation to the line4T model using all recognized sensors

Classification:
-baggedClassTrees - uses bagged classification trees and allows the user to select how many trees to fit
-clusterAll - tries to cluster data into categories (unsupervised).  Fits to 1:10 clusters and then allows user to specify number of clusters to use as the estimate
-GLM_MultiClass - fits a linear model to a binomially distributed reference value (true/false) for each column of Y for e.g. leak detection or source ID
-LDA_Classifier - fits a multi-class linear discriminant model to predict classes
-patternNet_multiClass - fits a shallow neural network for multi-class classification problems
-podClassTree - uses fitctree to try to create and prune a classification tree
-podkNN_Class - fits a k-nearest neighbor classification model
-podMultinomial - fits a multinomial regression using all of X
-podPatternRecog - uses a neural net to identify patterns and classify data
-SVM_Classifier - fits a multi-class support vector machine classification model
%}
%***Preprocessing functions
%{
-addACF - adds columns with a rolling autocorrelation for each variable
-addDerivatives - adds columns for each variable with the time derivative
-addRollingVar - uses "movvar" to add a rolling variance for each variable
-addSolarAngle - adds a column with solar angle "alpha" (currently using a fixed GPS coordinate)
-addTimeofDay - adds a column "ToD" that ranges from 0 at midnight to 2 at noon in a sine wave-like function
-clusterContin2Categ - uses k-means clustering to convert a matrix of continuous variables to categorical clusters
-easyRbyR0 - NOT QUITE WORKING? Converts voltage to resistance by assuming a voltage divider and then tries to find a "clean air" resistance and divides the calculated resistance by that value 
-humidrel2abs - converts relative humidity to absolute humidity
-joinPodsData - joins the data from all pods together (this means that looping through each pods is essentially repeating the same analysis multiple times)
-makeCategorical - converts each column to a categorical variable
-makePCs - centers and scales each variable and then performs a PCA and allows the user to select the number of PCs to keep. Saves the information necessary to convert new data into the PC space
-makeDiscontTElaps - adds "telapsed" column that ignores gaps longer than "t_gap", which is specified in the function code (currently 5 minutes)
-makeTElapsed - adds "telapsed" column calculated as t - min(t)
-normalizeMat - center and scale each variable by its standard deviation
-plotWavelets - plots the 2D wavelet power spectrum for each sensor or reference value
-podTimeZone - adjusts the pod data to match the reference timezone entered above under "settingsSet.refTZ"
-podSmooth - applies the smoothing method selected by "podSmooth" and "refSmooth" in the settings set
-refTimeZone- same as podTimeZone, but this moves reference data to match the pod timezone and allows reference files to be in different timezones
-RbyR0 - uses a file titled "ResistanceValues.csv" in the "Logs" folder to divide each sensor by its clean air resistance value
-referenceSpikeFilter - similar filtering to that included in Ricardo's code.  Assigns NaN values to points that differ from the point before or after them by more than 2 std deviations as calculated on a 60 minute rolling window
-remove999 - removes values exactly equal to -999
-removeDST - adustst the timeseries to remove daylight savings time (allows for data that bridges the time change
-removeNaNs - remove rows that contain NaN values
-removeOOBtemp - removes unrealistic temperature values (assumes values are in K)
-removeSomeZeros - removes 2/3 of points that are exactly 0 to reduce overtraining on synthetic reference data
-removeToDTrends - fits a smooth function to values vs time of day and then removes the fitted diurnal trend
-removeZeros - adds a small, positive value (determined relative to the median) to values that are exactly zero
-rmWarmup - removes 60 minutes after a break in pod data that is longer than 5x the calculated typical interval
-sortbyTime - sorts the data by the timeseries in case it was imported out of order
-TempC2K - adjusts the "temperature" column to convert from celcius to kelvin
-waveletRemove - Not implemented yet, but want to filter data with SSA
%}
%***Validation functions
%{
-clusterVal - Select data groupings with k-means clustering on X data. Note that clusters will not be the same size and that group 1 will be the largest (most points dropped for validation)
-concentrationsFold - Select and drop percentiles of reference concentration starting with the highest levels
-environClusterVal - Select groups of data by clustering on temperature and humidity values
-prepostVal - Select groups of data from out to in (group 1 gets the first and last x points and group n is the middle)
-randHrsVal - Randomly assign hour blocks of data to folds
-randVal - Randomly select data points for validation while trying to maintain roughly the same number of points in each dataset
-temperatureFold - Select and drop percentiles of temperature starting with the lowest temperatures
-timeFold - Split the data into similarly sized folds based on the time from start to end
-timeofDayVal - Split data into quantiles where fold 1 is centered around noon, and the last fold is centered around midnight
%}
%***Plotting functions
%{
-acfPlot - plots the time lagged correlation of Y and podSensor{1} to check that the timestamps are well aligned (max correlation at t_lag=0)
-basicStatsBoxPlots - makes boxplots of variation in model statistics between different "folds" as calculated by "podRMSE", "podR2", and "podCorr" (for now)
-categoricalPlot - designed to plot the results of a classification problem with categorical results
-histogramsPlot - plots the distribution of estimated and true concentrations
-hourBoxPlot - creates hourly boxplots of concentrations for the reference and estimated data
-originalPlot - Creates a similar plot to that produced by Ricardo's "camp_plotting" function for each fitted model
-residsTrends - Plots the residuals (y_hat-y) versus each covariate, the timestamp, and the reference concentration
-timeofDayPlot - Plots all reference and estimate values by time of day, colored by the "telapsed" variable (if it exists), or by elapsed time calculated as (t - min(t))
-timeseriesPlot - plots the predictions of each calibration/validation fold as well as the reference data over the same period
-vsRefDens - like "vsReferencePlot", but plots density of estimates to see if there is any weird clumping that's hard to see in a scatter plot
-vsReferencePlot - plots predictions versus the reference data
-XYCorrelations - plots correlations between all variables in X and Y
%}
%***Statistical functions
%{
Regression:
-podCorr - Calculates the Spearman's rho correlation between estimates and reference concentrations
-podRMSE - Calculates the classic RMSE value on the validation and calibration datasets for each fold
-podR2 - Calculates the coefficient of determination (R^2) value on the validation and calibration datasets for each fold
-podSkewness - Calculate the "skewness" of the distributions of concentrations for the reference and for the estimates

Classification:
-podSilhouette - Plots the silhouette for each point comparing its similarity within its group to its similarity to other groups. Positive 1 =ideal, -1 = terrible (too many/too few clusters)
