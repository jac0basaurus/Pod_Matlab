# Pod_Matlab
This code is intended to accept data from the air quality sensing pods used by the Hannigan lab at CU Boulder and to apply a variety of different calibration functions to fit the data to reference measurements.  It has been structured in such a way as to be relatively easily configured for a variety of applications.
